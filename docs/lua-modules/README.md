# NodeMCU Lua modules directory

Reviewing, hosting and thus potentially maintaining an ever growing list of NodeMCU Lua modules (the ones here) does not scale well for the project team. Instead, we give the community a chance - and the responsibility - to maintain a directory of Lua modules found in the wild through the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/wiki/Lua-modules-directory).

In the (hopefully not too distant) future, we will request that Lua modules to be hosted _in this repository_ come with a test program in whatever framework [we end up adopting](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/issues/2145).

**A module being listed on the wiki does NOT mean the NodeMCU project team endorses it in any way.**
